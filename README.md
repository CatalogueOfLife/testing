# COL Release Tasks

Editorial tests and discussion to prepare for COL releases.
Issues are created for each release, e.g. [CoL of February 2024]([url](https://github.com/CatalogueOfLife/testing/issues/245)),
but there are also long living issues for each source to discuss specific changes and problems with custodians, e.g. [ITIS]([url](https://github.com/CatalogueOfLife/testing/issues/8)).
